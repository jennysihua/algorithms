SECURITY
  - XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)
    - Steps:
      1. Malicious data enters the server via an HTTP request from an untrusted source.
      2. Server-side validation either doesn't exist or is insufficient to catch the attack.
      3. The malicious data is included dynamic content the server sends to a user.
    - Kinds:
      - Mostly JS but can also be HTML, Flash, or any other kind of code.
      - Two main subtypes:
        - Persistent - actually saved in the server, and can occur without the attacker specifically targeting users.
        - Reflective - one-off, and must be triggered by the end user, who clicks on a masked link for example.
  - XSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)
  - SQL Injection
